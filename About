What is BMD(Bone mineral density machine)?
A Bone Mineral Density (BMD) machine is a specialized medical device used to measure the density 
and strength of bones. It is primarily used to diagnose conditions like osteoporosis and osteopenia, 
which are characterized by low bone mass and increased risk of fractures. By providing accurate and 
non-invasive measurements, BMD machines play a crucial role in preventive healthcare and in monitoring 
the effectiveness of treatments related to bone health.

Who have these BMD machines?
These machines are mostly occupied by the Hospitals or the Vendors(Who have the stock of this machines and what it to sell or rent it)

What is the purpose of building an website?
There is a communication gap between the Health care providers and the vendors
either the healthcare providers donot have the contact to communicate with the Vendors.
So, to minimize the communication gap between the vendors and the healthcare provider we have build a website which
minimizes the communication gap and provide the healthcare providers the suitable machines they require.

Speciality aout website.
1) This website is user friendly, easy to access for both healthcare providers either for renting or buying the a BMD machines
and for vendor to sell or give their machines on rent.
2) Clean and easy.
3) We do have a admin login who can track all the ongoing process.
